# Might Fail

A TypeScript library for handling async errors without `try` and `catch` blocks. Inspired by other languages that utilize Result or Either types for safer error handling.

## Quick Start

### Install

```
npm install might-fail
```

### Wrap Promise in `mightFail`

```ts
const { error, result } = await mightFail(axios.get("/posts"));

if (error) {
  // handle error
  return;
}

const posts = result.data!
posts.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
```

**or:**

```ts
const { error: networkError, result } = await mightFail(fetch("/posts"));

if (networkError) {
  // handle network error
  return;
}

if (!result.ok) {
  // handle an error response from server
  return;
}

const { error: convertToJSONError, result: posts } = await mightFail(
  result.json()
);

if (convertToJSONError) {
  // handle convertToJSONError
  return;
}

posts!.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
```

### Or Wrap Async Function in `makeMightFail`

```ts
const get = makeMightFail(axios.get);
const { error, result } = await get("/posts");

if (error) {
  // handle error
  return;
}

const posts = result.data!
posts.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
```

## Either Type

`await`ing the `mightFail` functions will return an `Either` type with either an `error` or a `result`.

- `error` always has the type `Error | undefined`.
- `result` always has the type `T | undefined` where `T` is the type of the result of the promise passed to `mightFail`.

This means that the you never lose the type information of the result of the promise passed to `mightFail`.

## Motivation

I think throwing exceptions is cool, I like that an exception breaks control flow and I like exception propogation. The only thing I don't like catching exceptions. This mostly happens at the most "user facing" part of the code like an api endpoint or a UI component, the outer most function call. So catching an exception needs to notify the user that something went wrong, log the error for debugging, and stop the currently execution flow. 

### Guard ‚úÖ

Guarding allows you to handle your errors early and return from the function early, making them more readable and easier to reason about.

```ts
const { error: networkError, result } = await mightFail(fetch("/posts"));
// guard against a network error
if (networkError) {
  return;
}
// guard against an error response from the server
if (!result.ok) {
  return;
}
const { error: convertToJSONError, result: posts } = await mightFail(
  result.json()
);
// guard against an error converting the response to JSON
if (convertToJSONError) {
  return;
}

// success case, unnested and at the bottom of the function
posts!.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
```

The success case is now the only code that is not nested in an `if` statement. It's also at the very bottom of the function making it easy to find.

### Everything in One Try/Catch Block ‚ùå

```ts
try {
  const response = await fetch("/posts");

  if (!response.ok) {
    // handle an error response from server
    return;
  }
  const posts = await response.json();

  posts!.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
} catch (error) {
  // handle any errors, not sure which one though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
}
```

This is bad because:

- Error handling happens in multiple places in the function.
- The catch block will catch **any** and **all** errors which makes it difficult to handle different errors differently.
- All the success case code will happen inside of the try block

### Multiple Try/Catch Blocks ‚ùå

```ts
let response: Response;
try {
  response = await fetch("/posts");
} catch (error) {
  // guard against a network error
  return;
}
if (!response.ok) {
  // guard against an error response from server
  return;
}

let posts: Post[];
try {
  posts = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
  // guard against an error converting the response to JSON
  return;
}

posts!.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
```

Declaring the variable ahead of time is a little weird and it makes infering the type of the variable a little more difficult. Also, try catch finally blocks can be confusing.

### `try` `catch` `finally` can be confusing ‚ùå

```ts
function something() {
  try {
    throw new Error("something went wrong");
  } catch(error) {
    console.log("error happened")
    return "error return"
  } finally {
    console.log("finally happened")
    return "finally return"
  }
  return "something return"
}
console.log(something())
```

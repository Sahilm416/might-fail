# Static Methods

`mightFail` has static methods that wrap the corresponding static methods of `Promise`.

- [`Promise.race`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)
- [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)
- [`Promise.allSettled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)
- [`Promise.any`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)


- `await mightFail.all([])`
- `await mightFail.allSettled([])`
- `await mightFail.race([])`
- `await mightFail.any([])`

These are identical to the static methods on `Promise` but they return an `Either` type.

## Change the way you catch errors

That's it, that's all this library helps you do. No major re-writes for your code base, no major changes at all. Just start handling your errors in a **much** better way.

You still throw errors or let other libraries throw errors. Just stop using `try, catch, finally` and use `mightFail` or `mightFailSync` instead.

## `catch` Sucks. Guarding is Good.

Guarding allows you to handle your errors early and return from the function early, making them more readable and easier to reason about.

```ts
const [ networkError, result ] = await mightFail(fetch("/posts"));
// guard against a network error
if (networkError) {
  return;
}
// guard against an error response from the server
if (!result.ok) {
  return;
}
const [ convertToJSONError, posts ] = await mightFail(
  result.json()
);
// guard against an error converting the response to JSON
if (convertToJSONError) {
  return;
}

// success case, unnested and at the bottom of the function
posts.map((post) => console.log(post.title));
```

The success case is now the only code that is **not** nested in another block. It's also at the very bottom of the function making it easy to find. 

<Important>
  The sucess case is always at the bottom of the function. All of your error handling logic is next to where the error might occur.
